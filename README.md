# Eau Claire's Salon
#### Special Project #9 for Epicodus, 10 March 2023
### by Mike Donovan

## Description

A C#/ASP.NET/EFCore web app that allows a user to view and edit a database of hair stylists and associated clients.

## Technologies Used:
* C#
* .NET
* ASP.NET
* Entity Framework Core

## Setup/Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. In the repo folder, navigate to `HairSalon/` and open `appsettings.json.example`.
3. Replace `[YOUR-DB-NAME]`, `[YOUR-USER-HERE]`, and `[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE]` with your own credentials.
4. Save the file as `appsettings.json`.
5. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash).
6. Navigate to this project's production directory called "VendorTracker".
7. If don't have the `dotnet-ef` package installed globally, run the command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0`.
8. If you don't have the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package installed, run the command `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design -v 6.0.0`.
9. Start a local development server with a program such as MySQL Workbench on port 3306.
10. Run `dotnet ef database update` in the command line.
11. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
12. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. For more information, [visit the Microsoft documentation on dev-certs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-dev-certs).

## Known Bugs

* On the "Edit Client" screen, the "Back to List" button always goes back to the full client list even if the user got there from a link in a partial list on a "Stylist Details" page.
